## Share your lightsaber "vhuoooms" with the world, thanks to MySaber

### Inspired by our immense love of Star Wars, we wanted to bring the experience of owning your own lightsaber to the world in the convinced of being in your pocket

### You can record your own voice or pick from a database of other recorded lightsaber sounds so pose as yours, when you swing your phone with all your Jedi might, it will sound just like the real thing!

### We used Python (using flask) for the sound server and Java (using Android Studio) for the UI and functionality of the app
